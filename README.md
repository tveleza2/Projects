## About me
As a Physics Engineer, I have applied my knowledge in physics and programming to contribute to environmental projects, especially in waste management. Our collaboration has enabled the development of innovative solutions that optimize data processing, a testament to my ability to work in a team and plan projects effectively.

My academic background, combined with various additional courses, has equipped me with technical skills in Python and other software tools. I am motivated by problem-solving and have a passion for continuous learning, which drives me to always seek excellence in the projects I am involved in.
